# Mini-Project : Chess Game in C++ ‚ôö

Made by ** Nathan W **

## Project Presentation

This project was made for the C++ programming course at the [**Telecom Physique Strasbourg**](https://www.telecom-physique.fr/) engineering school. The goal was to create a chess game in C++.

## ‚ú® How to use ?

### 1 ‚îÄ Download dependencies and Install

- If G++ is not installed on your computer, run these commands, as the `makefile` requires G++ as the compiler.

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install build-essential
$ sudo apt install g++
```

- Clone the repository with git

### 2 ‚îÄ Use Makefile

Compile the project using the following command :

```bash
$ make
```

### 3 ‚îÄ Run the program
To begin a game, run the following command :
```bash
$ ./echecs
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è In-game Commands

- To move a piece, enter the coordinates of the piece you want to move, followed by the coordinates of the square you want to move it to. For example, to move the pawn at a2 to a4, enter `a2a4`.

- If you want to forfeit the game, enter `/resign`.

- If you want to draw the game, enter `/draw`.

- If you want to quit the game, enter `/quit`.

## ‚ôüÔ∏è En passant explanation

As i did not create auxiliary functions for the en passant process, i will break it down here (everything about this is handled in the movepiece function)
En passant captures are only available if the pawn has moved 2 squares forward only in the last move.
In order to "memorize" this, i created 2 arrays, one for each colour, as private members of the Board class.
After each move, the whole array is reset to zero, and if a pawn moved 2 squares forward, the corresponding indice is set to true.
Simple as that.
I had to add a verification in the movepiece function to check if the move is an en passant capture, and if it is, remove the pawn that is being captured.
